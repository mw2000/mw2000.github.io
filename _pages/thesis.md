This is an ever-evolving document representing my view of the world, society, and business at large.


### Opening up siloed industries to contributors from all around the world
The advent of github and other open source developer tooling led to the rise of open source software developers who could contribute to and build new libraries and projects, developing their skills and reputations, as well as producing quality software in the process. A platform like github opened up software development to everyone around the world and allowed the breaking down of barriers like university requirements or lack of access to local opportunities to become a world-class software developer. Similarly, we need more such platforms that will open opportunities for individuals across a variety of industries to reliably contribute, and build upon shared, open work. Education, research and rideshare models are leaning towards this model.

### More value creation opportunities for the individual.
Since the great resignation of 2020-2021, we see that individuals are slowly moving away from a job market, which is great. In a capitalist system, we must focus on owning capital, not performing labor. Labor is a means of escape to gain capital. With the advent of AI, it only makes sense to have lesser workers and more capital owners investing and creating their own companies. This way the remaining people performing labor will also be paid higher wages, and resulting immigration will result in development of immigrants' home countries through remittances.

### Limitless growth in an infinite world.
Since the advent of modern capitalism post the industrial revolution, the human standard of living has grown exponentially, and has created a positive sum world. However, despite our best and efficient use, this growth has an upperbound in terms of Earth's total available resources. This can be sidestepped by building low-cost space launch and space mission capabilities. Asteroid mining, planet terraforming, space elevators, skyhooks are all key to this, as are current spacex rockets.

### Cheap, clean energy.
Energy is the true currency of the world. Access to energy determines how much value a nation can produce. This is the reason why the United States and other great powers fight wars over oil, and why the petrodolar agreement between US and Saudi is important. This will shift significantly in the next few decades as nuclear fission, solar and wind take center stage in the fight against climate change, and once again when we get nuclear fusion to be commercially viable. Clean, cheap energy is key for human progress.

### Reformed capitalism with increased market efficiency and stakeholders.
Capitalism gets a bad rep due to the monopolization created at the top. This is due to old fashioned corruption and collusion. We need to prevent/reduce this, by de-regulation, re-regulation, and technologically-enforced regulation. Regulation that reduces competent competition is inefficient and will cause more damage than harm. Humans/Bureacrats cause huge inefficiency's in this system, so we must reduce the amount of human interference in regulation as possible. An efficient market will improve capitalist systems. A carbon tax is also necessary for all businesses, as a large carbon footprint is bad for the planet.

### High-value Capital Consumption is a net negative
Every individual has a set of necessities and a set of desires, however it is important to remember that the marginal advantage of a dollar decreases after a certain threshold, determined by the location of the individual. Greed for more consumption is a slippery slope that reduces efficient utilization of earned money and one of the excesses of post-modern capitalism. If money spent << value added by money spent, its inefficient.

### Investing in people has the highest returns
If humans (collectively) were a company, they would be one of the best assets to invest in. Since this isn't the case, we need to have a way to invest capital in the development of a group of individuals such that this investment will direct the human to a path that creates more value to society. This has a chance of turning tyranical which must be avoided, but by investing in communities directly, lasting change can be created.
