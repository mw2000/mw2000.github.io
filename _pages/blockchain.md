I got acquinted with blockchain towards the end of 2017, with the bitcoin bubble gaining momentum. My initial response was to try mining, however with no specialized hardware, this project ended in a failure. After this, I learnt about Ethereum and got familar with DApp development through the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) tutorial.

On entering UC Davis, I joined Blockchain @ Davis, a student run club focusing on blockchain education and dApp development. Throughout my time at Blockchain at Davis, as a member, project manager and now president, I was able to participate in hackathons and educational oppporunities, connect with blockchain researchers on Campus, and help form partnerships between Blockchain at Davis and other orgs and companies. All of which has culminated in the formation of UC Davis' first blockchain course in partnership with Blockchain at Davis, Blockchain Accelaration Foundation and ExpoLab.

When it comes to my personal blockchain ambitions, I'm intrigued by the Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and how they could be applied in current government setups. My project for HackDavis 2020, the annual UC Davis hackathon, Decentralized Autonomous Governance, was an idea based around applying the principle of DAO's to student-run university governments. Prior to this, I co-founded PlastiCoin, a blockchain-based plastic recycling startup, which was to harness the power of ERC20 tokens and the incentivizing feature of blockchain to bolster community based effective plastic waste management. The research for PlastiCoin was conducted under the guidance of Dr. Mohhamad Sadoghi and ExpoLab.
