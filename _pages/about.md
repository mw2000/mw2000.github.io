Hi! My name is Mihir and I'm glad that you stumbled across my website ðŸ˜ƒ.

I'm a junior at UC Davis, majoring in Computer Science. I'm a die
hard blockchain fanboy, and have been actively involved with the student-run club [Blockchain at Davis](http://www.blockchainatdavis.io/). You can read more about my blockchain stuff [here](https://mw2000.github.io/blockchain/). 

Apart from blockchain, I'm super passionate about space(X) travel and exploring what lies beyond the confines of Earth's blue skies. Through being a part of the [UC Davis Satellite and Systems Club](https://www.facebook.com/SpaceAndSatelliteSystems/), I'm able to pursue this passion of mine by contributing in building UC Davis' first CubeSAT. I was also a part of [RoveCrest](http://rovecrest.com/), a club focused on building a Mars Rover for [Mars Society's University Rover Competition](http://urc.marssociety.org/home/urc-news).

My hobbies include hours of video gaming, mainly multiplayer Minecraft and ranked Rocket League (Check out my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtvvuWeI7Ege7JoQTDyFrqw/) ðŸ˜‰), and playing poker with my friends on Friday evenings (with fake money of course).

I love building software projects, such as [Injecto](https://github.com/mw2000/Injecto/) and ideating about potential startups, one of which went on to become [PlastiCoin](https://mwadekar2000.wixsite.com/plasticoin). During internship recruitment season I'm usually on the leetcode grind, aiming for usually 3 easy questions and 1 medium or hard question per day.

I plan to branch out to learning more about Quantum Computing and Machine Learning. Groverâ€™s and Shor's algorithms in particular are something I'd love to explore owing to their potential to break encryption and blockchain security. 

I'm always on the look out for more cool stuff to learn about, work with and enjoy ðŸ™‚. Feel free to reach out to me at `mpwadekar [at] ucdavis [dot] edu`
