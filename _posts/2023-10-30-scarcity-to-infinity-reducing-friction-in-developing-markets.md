Small businesses are the backbone of any economy. In developing economies like India, these enterprises play a critical role, employing a vast sector of the population and driving economic activity. However, many such nations face a challenge: a significant portion of their economy operates informally. This informal operation often results in high unemployment and incremental lifestyle improvements over generations, even with apparent economic growth.

### Government Interventions

To address this, governments, both national and local, launch programs aimed at bolstering small businesses. The intention is noble, but in reality, many of these initiatives become mired in bureaucracy. Burdensome paperwork, prolonged delays, and a dependence on digital or in-person interfaces introduce substantial friction.

This friction often deters potential entrepreneurs. Consider the example of Robinhood. Before its emergence, retail trading was constrained by commissions and fixed fees, which excluded many average individuals. Robinhood's zero-fee model, combined with an intuitive interface, revolutionized the trading landscape. A decade later, commission-free trading is the norm across platforms, underscoring the impact of reducing friction.

### A New Business Ecosystem

Our focus should be on creating an environment where starting, running, and exiting a business is as seamless as possible. While optimizing the "running" aspect is complex due to the diverse nature of businesses, we can certainly streamline the beginning and end phases. For instance, in India, the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) market, though growing, predominantly favors tech or tech-adjacent firms. We need to democratize this, making even traditional businesses more liquid.

Imagine a system where every small business owner can easily monitor their business valuation and access M&A opportunities. Combine this with convenient startup processes and we pave the way for what could be termed the "businessOS" of developing nations.

### The Potential Buyers and Impact

One might wonder about the potential buyers in this scenario. The market could comprise Private Equity funds, syndicates, and ordinary individuals seeking optimal returns with balanced risks, unlike the high-stakes world of Venture Capital. Such efficient capital allocation could usher in a renaissance of micro-enterprises.

Imagine a young individual in a developing nation. Instead of merely seeking employment, they could be inspired to establish their own venture - a repair shop, a grocery store, or even a farm. By facilitating scalability and rapid exit strategies, we empower billions to transition from labor-intensive roles to becoming capital owners. This shift embodies the essence of inclusive growth and unlocks the latent potential of capitalism.


In conclusion, reducing friction in the business ecosystem of developing nations isn't just about economic growth; it's about unleashing entrepreneurial spirit, empowering individuals, and truly realizing the promise of capitalism for all.
