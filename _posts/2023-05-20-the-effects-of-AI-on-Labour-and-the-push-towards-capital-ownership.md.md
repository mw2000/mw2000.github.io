The world has been witnessing a trend towards lower employment rates and higher productivity per worker since the industrial revolution. The emergence of the internet and software further accelerated this trend. With the impending arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) and advancements made by organizations like OpenAI and Sam Altman, the question of automation replacing jobs arises once again. This article explores the potential impact of AI on different sectors of the workforce and proposes the use of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) as a solution to mitigate the negative effects.

### The Impact on White-Collar Workers
AI is likely to replace jobs predominantly in the white-collar sector. While building general-purpose robots remains a complex task, professions such as copywriters, accountants, middle management, quants, and software engineers are expected to experience significant job displacement due to AI.

### The Impact on Blue-Collar Workers
In the short term, blue-collar workers may benefit as human physical labor becomes costlier to hire. However, advancements in robotics combined with AI could reach a point where the cost of employing humans outweighs the cost of using automated solutions like robots. This could lead to stagnating or declining wages for blue-collar workers.

### Rising Unemployment
The number of unemployed individuals is likely to increase as AI adoption reduces the overall availability of jobs. Those who have been out of work for a significant period may face even greater challenges in finding employment. Similar to past instances where machines rendered certain jobs obsolete, such as assembly line workers and printing press operators, individuals unable to reskill for an AI-driven workplace may become unemployable.

### The Potential of Sovereign Wealth Funds
Looking back at the growth of the software technology industry in the 1980s and 1990s, facilitated by venture capital (VC), we can see the importance of access to capital. VC firms like Sequoia played a crucial role in supporting companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Uber, and Amazon. Access to capital allows for innovation, growth, and longer-term projects, benefiting shareholders and the broader economy.

### Easier Access to Capital and Job Losses
National-scale access to capital, akin to what VC firms provide, is vital in the face of AI-induced job losses. AI will increase productivity per worker, leading to a reduced need for white-collar workers. However, those displaced workers could still be significantly more productive when paired with AI. To capture and enhance this value creation, pre-seed funding for promising ideas can be facilitated through a Sovereign Wealth Fund, similar to how Saudi Arabia manages its fund. Conflict of interest concerns should be addressed, and the fund could prioritize supporting good ideas rather than seeking the highest financial returns.

### Benefits and Funding
One of the significant advantages of this approach is that it does not require raising taxes. Increased productivity across sectors would boost supply, potentially bringing down inflation or even causing deflation. Tax collections from profitable ventures alone could compensate for any "money printing." This strategy aims to uplift individuals across the board while avoiding burdening the most successful value creators with extra taxation.

### Enabling the American Dream
The American dream of working hard and achieving success needs to be revitalized. Currently, success in America often relies on owning capital or being a value creator who captures the full value of their creations. Wages are depressed, and income inequality is prominent. While a solution that redistributes wealth may seem appealing, it becomes impractical and counterproductive beyond a certain point. Punishing the most successful value creators disincentivizes further value creation. Instead, by viewing the situation from an abundance mindset, AI can unlock significant growth and empower more people to pursue their ambitions
